#### How to prepare for Cycles 3 and 4
In response to interest from students about how to prepare for Cycles 3 and 4 over the mid-trimester vacation, here are some pointers to get you started.

#### Readings
[Klein, Chapter 16, Sections 16.1-16.10 - Conjugated Pi Systems and Pericyclic Reactions](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589&ppg=721)  
[Klein, Chapter 23 - Introduction to Organometallic Compounds](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589)   

===

### Cycle 3: Pericyclic reactions and reactive intermediates  

To prepare for this cycle, you should read [Sections 16.1-16.10 from Klein](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589&ppg=721), all of which are assessable. The early sections (16.1-16.7) may be familiar from previous organic chemistry courses.

The most relevant problems from this chapter are 16.39, 16.40, 16.42-16.46, 16.50-16.58, 16.64-16.68, 16.70-16.72 and 16.74-16.76. Problems 16.78-16.81 are good for a challenge!

Our brief coverage of reactive intermediates will focus on carbenes - [see Klein, Section 23.4](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589), although we will extend beyond what is covered in the textbook.  

[Lecture notes](https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/bbcswebdav/xid-23820555_1) are now also available for Cycle 3 on Learning@Griffith.  

### Cycle 4: Organometallic reactions  
To prepare for this cycle, you should read [Chapter 23 from Klein](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589&ppg=721), all of which is assessable. The early sections (23.1-2) may be familiar from previous organic chemistry courses.  

All problems from this chapter are relevant.
