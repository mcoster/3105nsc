#### Readings - Carbenes
[Klein, Chapter 23, Section 23.4 - Simmons-Smith reaction and carbenoids](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589) - p. 1063

### Cycle 3: Reactive Intermediates - Carbenes  

#### Carbenes  

Just a brief introduction to this topic. [Klein (Section 23.4, p. 1063)](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589) doesn't cover carbenes in great depth, but does have details of the Simmons-Smith Reaction and the &alpha;-elimination as a way to form dihalocarbenes. Here is a little more explanation:

Apart from that, the lecture and [lecture notes](https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/bbcswebdav/xid-23820555_1) for this topic delve a little deeper.  

#### Cycle 3: Revision    

In Week 6, we have tutorials on Thursday. Feel free to come along, armed with any questions you may have from the revision sheet below, the past quiz, Kahoot quizzes below, from the textbook or any other question from the course.

#### Practice problems  
The most relevant problems from Klein (3rd ed.) are 16.39, 16.40, 16.42-16.46, 16.50-16.58, 16.64-16.68, 16.70-16.72 and 16.74-16.76. Problems 16.78-16.81 are good for a challenge!
