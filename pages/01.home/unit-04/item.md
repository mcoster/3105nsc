##### Quiz 1 feedback and future quiz study tips  
Now that Quiz 1 marks and worked answers are online, I wanted to share a few tips about how to get the best mark you can for this course, going forward:  
**1. Textbook** - if you don't have the textbook, get it! If you aren't reading the designated sections, read them! Apart from that, try out as many of the practice problems as you can - testing has been shown in many studies to be the most effective study technique.  
**2. Study group** - join or start a study group. The [Slack Workspace](https://3105nsc-2018.slack.com) is a great place to organise this and there has already been one call out from a student interested in forming a study group. Social learning helps a number of ways - you can calibrate how you're going vs your classmates, through discussion, ideas take deeper meaning and your peers who are learning the material at the same time as you are often the best teachers of this new material.  
**3. Practice problems** - try the practice problems in advance of tutorials as much as possible - if anything is unclear, reach out for feedback - Slack or a study group are ideal venues.  
**4. Study worked answers from Quiz 1** - now that Quiz 1 is in the past, it may be tempting to never think about it again, _but_ concepts from each cycle are transferrable, and Cycle 1 is perhaps the most general. Have a look at the worked answers I posted, and watch my explainer videos. If you can see where your answers differed from mine, you can take those learnings forward into future cycles.  
**5. BACON** - all of the BACON tutorials have been selected to be relevant, in some way, to the topic of each cycle. Give them a decent chunk of time - I notice from the analytics that some people are skipping straight through to the assessed questions at the end. You're missing the biggest potential benefit of the BACON tutorials - the chance to revise and deepen learning about the topic from a different angle. And, if you haven't signed up or used it yet - it's not too late! Let me know if you need any assistance.  
**6. Course Hub and Key Concept videos** - for each of my cycles, be sure to read the relevant posts on this Course Hub and watch the [key concept videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPzKNZGxdSvwOlUUxtoHsL6C--A1_gt8N) I post.  
**7. Feedback** - if you have any questions, comments, suggestions going forward, please make yourself heard on the [Slack Workspace](https://3105nsc-2018.slack.com), on the [feedback Padlet](https://padlet.com/m_coster/3105nsc) or by email! I very much welcome any suggestions on how to best facilitate your learning of organic chemistry during the remainder of the trimester.  

_Good luck!_
