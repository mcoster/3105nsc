#### How to Prepare for your first lab session  

1. Confirm your date, time and starting experiment via the above documents
1. Read the experimental procedures for your starting experiment
1. Find relevant safety data for the chemicals you will be using in your experiment  
1. Revise any unfamiliar techniques and concepts  
1. Watch the relevant technique videos below  

### Lab technique videos  

The following videos have been prepared to help you familiarise yourself with key relevant techniques before coming to the lab. They have been made intentionally silent (it's not a fault!). The lab technique videos are grouped into:  

- [common, general techniques](#general-techniques)
- [Experiment 1 techniques](#experiment-1)
- [Experiment 2 techniques](#experiment-2)

#### General techniques <a id="general-techniques"></a>  

##### Weighing chemicals  
When weighing at a balance, it is really important that material transfers occur away from the balance pan, otherwise spilled chemicals quickly get into the balance mechanism and lead to damage. If any spills occur in the balance area, they must be cleaned up before moving on.
