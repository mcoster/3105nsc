#### Readings - Pericyclic reactions
[Klein, Chapter 16, Sections 16.1-16.10 - Conjugated Pi Systems and Pericyclic Reactions](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589&ppg=721)  

===

### Cycle 3: Pericyclic reactions  

#### Before the lectures  

To prepare for this cycle, you should read [Sections 16.1-16.10 from Klein](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589&ppg=721), all of which are assessable. The early sections (16.1-16.7) may be familiar from previous organic chemistry courses.  

The most relevant problems from this chapter are 16.39, 16.40, 16.42-16.46, 16.50-16.58, 16.64-16.68, 16.70-16.72 and 16.74-16.76. Problems 16.78-16.81 are good for a challenge!  

#### Pi molecular orbitals  

To understand pericyclic reactions, it is important to comprehend conjugated pi systems and particularly the pi molecular orbitals that are produced by combining contiguous p orbitals. Can you arrange the following pi molecular orbitals from lowest to highest in energy?

### Cycle 1: Reaction mechanisms  

#### Before the lectures  
Reaction mechanisms fascinate organic chemists. Why is that? A mechanism, like any scientific theory, can never be _proven_. So, why bother? Have a think about it and we will discuss it in class.  

For this cycle, you will need to read [Chapter 6 of Klein]((https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589&ppg=246)) and watch the following _Key Concept_ videos. Do it in either order - whatever works for you.

##### Kinetic vs thermodynamic control  
A key concept to master in organic chemistry is the difference between _kinetic_ and _thermodynamic_ control in reaction outcomes. As you watch this video, consider this question - _why is there sometimes a difference between the kinetic and the thermodynamic products of a reaction?_

For an unusual take on thermodynamic vs kinetic control, [read this post](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2012/02/09/can-opener-economics/) at Master Organic Chemistry (MOC).  

##### The Hammond postulate  
Next up is the _Hammond postulate:_  

[plugin:youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et0Y7z-sLUg)  
Now that you've watched the video, _can you think of any situations where the postulate might be useful in predicting or explaining a reaction outcome?_ For further discussion of the Hammond postulate, read [this post](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2011/09/28/hammonds-postulate/) at MOC.  

##### Curly arrows in ionic mechanisms  
Moving away from energy diagrams, perhaps the most important skill for an organic chemist in proposing a mechanism is the ability to "push" curly arrows. Here are some guidelines about the four types of steps that can be combined together to show mechanisms for the majority of organic reactions:

I mention in that video that carbon atoms with 5 bonds are "against the rules". What rules am I talking about? Why is this the case? This is actually one of the most common mistakes made by undergraduate students in exams and quizzes. The pentavalent carbon atom, or [_"Texas carbon"_](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/common-mistakes-in-organic-chemistry-pentavalent-carbon/), sticks out like a sore thumb to experienced chemists. _What tricks could you use to avoid making a "Texas carbon" mistake in a quiz?_
