##### What do you need to do for the group presentation?  
The course includes a [Group Presentation](https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/bbcswebdav/xid-22718812_1) assessment item, where groups of 3-4 students will work together to teach others about a "Named Reaction" in organic chemistry.

**Note: A [PDF version of these instructions](https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/bbcswebdav/xid-22718812_1) is available on Learning@Griffith**

#### Topic selection  
You are now able to select a topic for your group presentation by heading to [Learning@Griffith](https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/execute/announcement?method=search&context=course_entry&course_id=_64774_1&handle=announcements_entry&mode=view) and clicking on _Group Assignment_ &rarr; _Topic selection / Group sign-up_. All students who select a topic will work on that topic as a group. There will be 3-4 students per group.

#### Your aim  
The task for this assignment is to teach the other 3105NSC students about a "Named Reaction" in Organic Chemistry.  

#### Format  
The format for your assignment submission can be any form of multimedia presentation that serves the purpose of teaching the topic in an effective way. This could be:  

* a video - eg. hosted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/home) or similar  
* an infographic or poster - eg. using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), Powerpoint, or similar  
* a webpage - eg. using [Strikingly](https://www.strikingly.com/), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/) or similar  
* presentation slides - eg. using Google Slides, Powerpoint, [Visme](https://www.visme.co/), [slides.com](https://slides.com/), [swipe](https://www.swipe.to/), or similar  

Let your creativity flow! The only limitation is that it must be accessible to all other students and teaching staff without installing special software - the above suggestions will all allow you to share a link to the final product or to generate a PDF that anyone can download.  

#### Preparation  
You can use textbooks, online materials, review articles and primary journal articles to research your topic. It is recommended that you cite at least 3 references in your presentation and one of these should be a recent primary research article in which your Named Reaction is used.  

#### Content  
The presentation should present a brief background to the Named Reaction - eg. when was it first discovered and by who? What chemical transformation takes place? What reagents are normally used? You should provide a "curly arrow" mechanism for the reaction. Lastly, provide some examples of how the reaction has been used. You are particularly encouraged to find very recent examples of the use of this reaction in synthesis, eg. last 5 years.

#### Length  
Due to the variety of formats available, there are no set limitations on length of the assignment. Students should provide a presentation that adequately teaches the topic without being comprehensive. Students should aim for their presentation to be digestible within a ~ 10 minute timeframe, ie. a video that is shorter than 10 minutes, or an infographic that takes less than 10 minutes to read.  

#### Submission  
Submission of your assignment will be in multiple stages via PebblePad worksheets:

| Due date | Item |
| -------- | ---- |
| 5 pm, Fri 16 March (wk 3) | _Individuals_ submit a PebblePad Cover Sheet |
| 5 pm, Thu 29 March (wk 5) | One group member (the "Submitter") submits *draft* presentation for the group |
| 5 pm, Fri 20 April (wk 6) | _Individuals_ provide feedback on at least two other group's presentations |
| 5 pm, Fri 4 May (wk 8) | One group member (the "Submitter") submits a *final* presentation for the group |
| 5 pm, Fri 4 May (wk 8) | _Individuals_ submit a PebblePad Group-work reflections worksheet |


#### Marking guidelines  
The assignment is marked out of 10 and contributes 10% to your overall mark for the course. To pass the course, the assignment must be submitted in full and receive a mark &ge;5.  

All members of the group get the same mark for these components -  
:fa-check: _submitted a draft presentation_ (1 mark)  
:fa-check: _quality of final presentation as a learning tool_ (2 marks)  
:fa-check: _structure and quality of presentation_ (1 mark)  
:fa-check: _diagrams are original_ (1 mark)  
:fa-check: _references are provided_ (1 mark)  
:fa-check: _example from recent primary literature is provided_ (1 mark)  

These marks are given on the basis of individual work -  
:fa-check: _provided constructive feedback on two other presentations_ (2 marks)  
:fa-check: _submitted a completed Reflections worksheet_ (1 mark)
