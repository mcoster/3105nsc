##### What do you need to do for the group presentation?  
The course includes a [Group Presentation](https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/bbcswebdav/xid-22718812_1) assessment item, where groups of 3-4 students will work together to teach others about a "Named Reaction" in organic chemistry.

**Note: A [PDF version of these instructions](https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/bbcswebdav/xid-22718812_1) is available on Learning@Griffith**

#### Topic selection  
You are now able to select a topic for your group presentation by heading to [Learning@Griffith](https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/execute/announcement?method=search&context=course_entry&course_id=_64774_1&handle=announcements_entry&mode=view) and clicking on _Group Assignment_ &rarr; _Topic selection / Group sign-up_. All students who select a topic will work on that topic as a group. There will be 3-4 students per group.

#### Your aim  
The task for this assignment is to teach the other 3105NSC students about a "Named Reaction" in Organic Chemistry.  

#### Format  
The format for your assignment submission can be any form of multimedia presentation that serves the purpose of teaching the topic in an effective way. This could be:  

* a video - eg. hosted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/home) or similar  
* an infographic or poster - eg. using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), Powerpoint, or similar  
* a webpage - eg. using [Strikingly](https://www.strikingly.com/), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/) or similar  
* presentation slides - eg. using Google Slides, Powerpoint, [Visme](https://www.visme.co/), [slides.com](https://slides.com/), [swipe](https://www.swipe.to/), or similar  

Let your creativity flow! The only limitation is that it must be accessible to all other students and teaching staff without installing special software - the above suggestions will all allow you to share a link to the final product or to generate a PDF that anyone can download.  

#### Preparation  
You can use textbooks, online materials, review articles and primary journal articles to research your topic. It is recommended that you cite at least 3 references in your presentation and one of these should be a recent primary research article in which your Named Reaction is used.  

#### Content  
The presentation should present a brief background to the Named Reaction - eg. when was it first discovered and by who? What chemical transformation takes place? What reagents are normally used? You should provide a "curly arrow" mechanism for the reaction. Lastly, provide some examples of how the reaction has been used. You are particularly encouraged to find very recent examples of the use of this reaction in synthesis, eg. last 5 years.

#### Originality

An important requirement of this assignment is that *all chemistry material
submitted* must be *created by the group members*. All chemical structures must
be drawn by the team, and all text must be created by the team. *No cutting &
pasting of any chemistry content is allowed, even with attribution/referencing*.
You are, however, allowed to use non-chemistry content as eg. Background images,
etc, as long as you have the right to do so. A safe option is to ensure that the
images you use have been shared under a “Creative Commons” license. There are
numerous websites with free, high definition images that can be used in this
way, eg. Unsplash.com, Pexels.com, etc.

#### Chemical structures

As stated above, all chemical structures must be drawn by the group – no copying
and pasting is allowed. As such, structures may be hand drawn or drawn using a
variety of chemical structure drawing programs. The choice is up to the
individual group and may be based on the format of the presentation, eg. a
YouTube tutorial style video may be highly effective with neat, hand-drawn
structures, whereas an infographic, webpage or presentation slides would look
quite unprofessional.

There are a large number of software packages available for chemical structure
drawing. Here are some that are available for free:

**cDraw** – this software has been created right here at Griffith University by
A/Prof. Andreas Hofmann! It is completely free to use. It requires Java to be
installed, meaning it will work on PC, Mac and Linux, but does not work on many
mobile devices, eg. iPhones, iPads, etc. It is currently being actively
developed and enhanced, so feel free to send Andy feedback!  
<http://www.structuralchemistry.org/pcsb/cdraw.php>

**MarvinSketch** – this software is part of a much larger, comprehensive suite
of chemistry programs. It is available for free for educational purposes under a
restricted license. To make the structure look nice, you will need to go to the
menu: *File* → *Document Style* → *Settings* → *Apply journal style preset* and
select a style from the menu. “ACS” is a good all-round choice.

**ChemDoodle** – very slick interface, however, only available for free as a
“trial” version.  
<https://www.chemdoodle.com/>

**ACD/ChemSketch** – is available free for academic and personal use.  
<http://www.acdlabs.com/resources/freeware/chemsketch/>

**BKChem** – until cDraw was developed at Griffith, BKChem was one of the few
simple, completely free chemical structure drawing programs. Unfortunately, it
appears to no longer be actively developed and has a few bugs. Nevertheless, if
you have trouble with the other software above, it may be worth trying.

#### Length  
Due to the variety of formats available, there are no set limitations on length of the assignment. Students should provide a presentation that adequately teaches the topic without being comprehensive. Students should aim for their presentation to be digestible within a ~ 10 minute timeframe, ie. a video that is shorter than 10 minutes, or an infographic that takes less than 10 minutes to read.  

#### Submission  
Submission of your assignment will be in multiple stages via PebblePad worksheets:

| Due date | Item |
| -------- | ---- |
| 5 pm, Fri 16 March (wk 3) | _Individuals_ submit a PebblePad Cover Sheet |
| 5 pm, Thu 29 March (wk 5) | One group member (the "Submitter") submits *draft* presentation for the group |
| 5 pm, Fri 20 April (wk 6) | _Individuals_ provide feedback on at least two other group's presentations |
| 5 pm, Fri 4 May (wk 8) | One group member (the "Submitter") submits a *final* presentation for the group |
| 5 pm, Fri 4 May (wk 8) | _Individuals_ submit a PebblePad Group-work reflections worksheet |


#### Marking guidelines  
The assignment is marked out of 10 and contributes 10% to your overall mark for the course. To pass the course, the assignment must be submitted in full and receive a mark &ge;5.  

All members of the group get the same mark for these components -  
:fa-check: _submitted a draft presentation_ (1 mark)  
:fa-check: _quality of final presentation as a learning tool_ (2 marks)  
:fa-check: _structure and quality of presentation_ (1 mark)  
:fa-check: _diagrams are original_ (1 mark)  
:fa-check: _references are provided_ (1 mark)  
:fa-check: _example from recent primary literature is provided_ (1 mark)  

These marks are given on the basis of individual work -  
:fa-check: _provided constructive feedback on two other presentations_ (2 marks)  
:fa-check: _submitted a completed Reflections worksheet_ (1 mark)
