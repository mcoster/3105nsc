### Welcome  
Welcome to 3105NSC Advanced Organic Chemistry for T1, 2018. If you haven't already, then you should sign up for the [BACON tutorials](https://learnbacon.com) using the details provided in the Announcement on Learning@Griffith. Tackling these tutorials is the best way to prepare for this class.  

##### Preparatory work
This year the course will run substantially differently to previous years, and will likely be different in structure to most other science courses you have taken. The course material is split into 5 cycles. For each of the cycles that I ([Mark](https://mcoster.net)) teach, you will need to undertake readings from the required textbook, other sources and to watch some _"Key Concept"_ videos that I have prepared. Doing this preparatory work before lectures will allow us to use lecture time to focus on application, analysis and problem solving using these concepts. I host the videos on YouTube - you can [subscribe to my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFCx1oD6NEtnyf-PExyDwlw?view_as=subscriber) and be notified when I post new ones. All my videos for this course will go into the ["Organic chemistry key concepts" playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HLU4uJ8Ev8&list=PLPzKNZGxdSvwOlUUxtoHsL6C--A1_gt8N). Also, please feel free to leave a comment, particularly constructive feedback - it's always good to know how things could be improved.

##### Required text  
The required text for this course is _Organic Chemistry_, 3rd edition, by Klein. Some of you may have used the 2nd edition previously, which is still satisfactory for much of the material covered in this course. However, the material in Cycle 4 is entirely absent from the 2nd edition. The E-Text version of this textbook is [available from Wiley Direct](http://www.wileydirect.com.au/buy/organic-chemistry-3rd-edition/) for $65 or for $85 with access to additional homework, practice questions and interactive study tools. Numerous studies have shown that undertaking practice tests and assessments are highly effective study techniques, much better than repeated reading, so the additional expense may be a wise investment. There is also an electronic version of this textbook [available through the Griffith University library, via ProQuest](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589). Note that the hardcopy versions of this 3rd edition are not yet available in Australia.

### Cycle 1: Reaction mechanisms  

#### Before the lectures  
Reaction mechanisms fascinate organic chemists. Why is that? A mechanism, like any scientific theory, can never be _proven_. So, why bother? Have a think about it and we will discuss it in class.  

For this cycle, you will need to read [Chapter 6 of Klein]((https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/reader.action?docID=4806589&ppg=246)) and watch the following _Key Concept_ videos. Do it in either order - whatever works for you.

##### Kinetic vs thermodynamic control  
A key concept to master in organic chemistry is the difference between _kinetic_ and _thermodynamic_ control in reaction outcomes. As you watch this video, consider this question - _why is there sometimes a difference between the kinetic and the thermodynamic products of a reaction?_

For an unusual take on thermodynamic vs kinetic control, [read this post](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2012/02/09/can-opener-economics/) at Master Organic Chemistry (MOC).  

##### The Hammond postulate  
Next up is the _Hammond postulate:_

Now that you've watched the video, _can you think of any situations where the postulate might be useful in predicting or explaining a reaction outcome?_ For further discussion of the Hammond postulate, read [this post](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2011/09/28/hammonds-postulate/) at MOC.  

##### Curly arrows in ionic mechanisms  
Moving away from energy diagrams, perhaps the most important skill for an organic chemist in proposing a mechanism is the ability to "push" curly arrows. Here are some guidelines about the four types of steps that can be combined together to show mechanisms for the majority of organic reactions:

I mention in that video that carbon atoms with 5 bonds are "against the rules". What rules am I talking about? Why is this the case? This is actually one of the most common mistakes made by undergraduate students in exams and quizzes. The pentavalent carbon atom, or [_"Texas carbon"_](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/common-mistakes-in-organic-chemistry-pentavalent-carbon/), sticks out like a sore thumb to experienced chemists. _What tricks could you use to avoid making a "Texas carbon" mistake in a quiz?_
